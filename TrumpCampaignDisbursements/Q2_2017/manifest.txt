two_year_transaction_period: 2018
This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the
Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
(contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
have the date  of the transation, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
specified, the results default to the most current cycle.
